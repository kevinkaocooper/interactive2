			A hover state is a CSS psuedo-class, the :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them. Most often we think of hover effects applying to <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">links</a></span>, however, <span id="any">any</span> <span style="text-transform: lowercase; color:red;">HTML</span> element <img id="pizza" src="assets/img/pizza.jpg" /> can have a hover state. You can even effect your <span class="mouse">mouse cursor</span> while hovering.
