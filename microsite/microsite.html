  <h3 style="text-align:center;">2x4 design series 3 exhibition</h3>
  <p>From May 13 through November 27, 2005, the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art (SFMOMA) presents the exhibition 2x4/design series 3, showcasing works by
the New York–based graphic design firm 2x4. Organized by Joseph Rosa, the
SFMOMA Helen Hilton Raiser Curator of Architecture and Design, design series 3
is the Museum’s third annual exhibition devoted to emerging talents in the fields of
architecture, graphic design, and industrial design. The objective of the series is to
identify and provide exposure for artists and designers at the forefront of their
disciplines who have not yet had solo museum exhibitions. A small-format catalogue
will accompany the presentation.
</br>
</br>
 “Once perceived as a marginal discipline within twentieth-century design
ideology, graphic design is changing into one of the most inclusive and visible
design categories,” states Rosa. “2x4 is a leader in this ideological shift. Its irreverent, critical methodology moves
branding and environmental design into new areas at once contextual and avant-garde.”
</br>
</br>
2x4 is a collaborative group of creative directors, writers, and designers founded by partners Michael Rock, Susan
Sellers, and Georgianna Stout in 1994. With cutting-edge projects spanning print, Web, motion graphics, and
environmental design, 2x4 emphasizes critical thinking and research. Known for intellectual content and explorations
of rhetorical meaning, many of the studio’s projects question the nature of design and are as much about the thought
process behind each work as they are about the finished product.
</br>
</br>
This ideology, based on an algorithmic approach, is the foundation for 2x4’s pioneering model for design—one that makes process the product.
For this exhibition, 2x4 will present its full range of design activity through a series of graphic and media
presentations. The gallery will consist primarily of custom-designed wallcoverings, video experiences, and a selection
of book “sketches”—all representing high-profile projects executed for clientele including ANY magazine, the Brooklyn Museum, the Illinois Institute of Technology with Rem Koolhaas/Office for Metropolitan Architecture
(OMA), KnollTextiles, Prada, Princeton School of Architecture, and Swiss furniture manufacturer Vitra.</p>
