			After spending years designing custom wallpapers, </br>Knoll Textiles invited us to design a collection of vinyl wallcoverings and woven upholstery fabrics for their </br>2005 season.
			</br>
			</br>
			We came up with two design collections: Chatter and </br>Field Theory. Both collections share a similar methodology: create pattern out of simple, mundane graphic elements.The Chatter collection is composed entirely of punctuation. Pause uses commas and periods, Plus is made entirely of plus signs, and Command uses only exclamation marks to make repeating patterns. Field Theory uses one form — an extruded box — in three different scales to create diverse effects. Urban is a grand scale pattern with dynamic forms. Exurban, a long strings of the boxes with moderately varied extrusions, and Suburban a houndstooth of repetitive boxes.

				The Muhammad Ali Center is a museum and cultural center located in Louisville, KY. We were asked to create a visual facade for the building using one by two ceramic tiles in nine custom colors. The design of the facade uses photographs by Howard L. Bingham of Ali, with the portrait broken into rough pixelated images. Up close, the portraits become a pattern; at a distance, the tiles resolve into dramatic large-scale portraits of Ali.

		2 × 4's facade design for the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, scheduled to open in 2005, utilizes strong, colorful, and imaginative images to convey the bravado of the world's greatest heavyweight boxer. A series of latger-than-life portraits of Ali wrap the exterior of Beyer Blinder Belle Architects' windowles four-story structure. Rather than attaching banners or photographs to the facade, 2 × 4 has integrated the forty-foot-heigh images into the very skin of the building, composing the graphics from ceramic tiles in a limited selection of colors. Seen from afar, the tiles form a recognizable montage of Ali imagery; on close viewing, the arrangemnet breaks down into an abstract mosaic of color.
